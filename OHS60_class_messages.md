Thanks for the note Darrell. It's always interesting to hear bits of information about classmates. Perhaps one of these days I will stop resisting Facebook. 

Wishing the best for all of you,

Iâ€™m really sorry that I didnâ€™t know about the reunion last September. Iâ€™m in the loop now, and look forward to the next time. Hope itâ€™s not too long!

Last Wednesday night 6 of us had supper with Mike Terry  in Ogallala.  He was going to Ft. Collins to visit Charles Smith.  Mike and Charles were going to climb a fourteener.  Mike has recovered from the bike accident he had last summer that put him on crutches for our class reunion in September.
 
On a sad note Margaret Ronneker Hein died the first part of August.  She was in our class for two years and graduated from Grant High School in 1960.  She is survived by two sons and sisters Cathy and Karen.
 
No more news,
